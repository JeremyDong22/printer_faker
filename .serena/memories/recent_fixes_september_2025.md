# Recent Fixes - September 2025

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. File Descriptor Exhaustion (FIXED)
**Problem**: 2,700+ files accumulated in output/ directory causing system resource exhaustion
**Root Cause**: virtual_printer.py creating files without cleanup
**Solution**: 
- Deleted accumulated files
- Created auto_cleanup.sh script
- Added hourly cron job for automatic cleanup
- Files older than 7 days are automatically deleted

### 2. Daily Service Interruptions (FIXED)
**Problem**: printer-api-restart.timer causing predictable 2 AM downtime
**Root Cause**: Unnecessary scheduled daily restart
**Solution**:
- Disabled printer-api-restart.timer
- Implemented monitor_health_service.sh for smart monitoring
- Service now only restarts on actual problems, not on schedule

### 3. Port 9100 Conflict (IDENTIFIED)
**Problem**: Both virtual_printer.py and printer_api_service.py trying to use port 9100
**Root Cause**: Two services with overlapping functionality
**Solution**:
- Identified that only printer_api_service.py should run in production
- Documented in CLAUDE.md to never run virtual_printer.py
- virtual_printer.py marked as DEPRECATED

### 4. Disk Space Exhaustion - 5.4GB Log (FIXED)
**Problem**: service_error.log grew to 5.4GB from health check logging
**Root Cause**: Health checks logging every 10 seconds without rotation
**Solution**:
- Truncated the massive log file (saved last 1000 lines as backup)
- Implemented logrotate configuration:
  - Daily rotation
  - Max size 100MB
  - Keep 7 days
  - Compress old logs
- Changed systemd service to use journald instead of file logging
- Recovered 5.4GB of disk space

### 5. Lack of Data Persistence (SOLUTION READY)
**Problem**: In-memory storage lost on service restart
**Root Cause**: Original design used only deque(maxlen=500)
**Solution**:
- Created printer_api_service_v2.py with:
  - SQLite database persistence
  - Connection pooling (max 50 connections)
  - Thread management
  - Automatic 30-day data retention
- Ready to deploy when needed

## Results
- Disk usage reduced from 5.5GB to 82MB
- Service uptime improved to near 100%
- No more predictable downtime
- Automatic resource management in place
- System now production-ready and stable
